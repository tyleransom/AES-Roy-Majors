# Simulations

The Monte Carlo simulations as described in Appendix A of the paper can be replicated by running the following files:

- `simulation.R`
- `simulationCorrEps.R`
- `simulationCorrEpsCorrEta.R`
- `simulation1e3.R`
- `simulation1e3CorrEps.R`
- `simulation1e3CorrEpsCorrEta.R`

and then running

- `cometogether.R`

The output at the end of `cometogether.R` is the set of results included in Table A1.
